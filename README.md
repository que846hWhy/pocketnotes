3. EthereumBinarySetupNode.txt
   ---------------------------
   This is a very quick and rough setup of a binary eth main node on a mounted disk on a VPS on Hetzner or DO
   However whats good it installs the latest version of geth 1.10.15 and uses the syncmode snap (formerly fast)
   Works really well.   Still playing with some of the parameters as of today its seems to work well with my pocket
   nodes.
